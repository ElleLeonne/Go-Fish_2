"Go Fish 2" is a negotiating and deal-making strategy game similar in play-style to Clue, and played with an ordinary deck of cards. It requires two players who have a desire to participate in a consensual and "fair" negotiating game, as judged by the players themselves. If at any point, one of the players feels slighted or is otherwise unsatisfied with the posture of the game, they may table the game, forcing a draw. They may also concede, granting the opposing player the win.

"Go Fish 2" is designed as both an introduction to and simulation of real world deal-making posture, where both parties must form and follow unspoken order and rules in order to reach an amicable conclusion (a victory on one player's part).

1: Each player begins the game by drawing a card at random.

2: Players take alternating turns. During a player's turn, they may do any of the following:

	A) Ask a Yes/No question pertaining to one or both of the cards in an opposing player's hand.
		- The opposing player may answer truthfully.
		- The opposing player may answer with "Go Fish" if they believe the active player has gotten greedy with their question, is acting in bad faith, or for any other reason that they choose.
		- The opposing player may communicate concerns about the question, offering the active player a chance to start their turn over and try again.

	B) Guess one of the cards in an opposing player's hand. This is technically the same as action A above, see rules below:
		- If the player guesses correctly, the opposing player immediately loses, and the game concludes.
		- If the player guesses incorrectly, they have effectively asked an extremely narrow question.
		- Players must be truthful about the cards in their hands.
		
	"Go Fish": In the event that a player is told to "Go Fish", they must immediately draw another card.
	
	Drawing: If any player would draw their fourth card in a game, the game immediately ends in a draw. Players may voluntarily concede before this occurs, to reward sportsmanlike conduct.
	Victory: If a player correctly asks a Yes/No question that correctly identifies one-and-only-one card, the opposing player must both answer truthfully in the affirmative and immediately concede the game.

These turns continue until only one player remains. The game is intended for two players, though more is theoretically possible if proper note-taking sheets are created to facilitate the increased overhead.

These rules may be revisited, and note-taking sheets may be made, in the event that this proves a useful exercise.
